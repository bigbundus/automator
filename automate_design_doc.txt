goal:

build a system that can accomplish repetive tasks
using python autogui

examples:

download all lectures from academind
download all parrot rooms froms patreon
download all sam hyde gumroads...

should be pretty easy, but take time make it really good and durable
something I'll come back to in a year and use.

So, key outline:

task_manager
task

some goal: download all academind lectures
break it down into tasks: download a single lecture, and advance to the next page

pyautogui notes:
dual monitor - left monitor is negative x...
does this depend on where the terminal is?
doesnt seem to
so lets confine usage to a single monitor

seem to have to wait a bit between scrolling and clicking - otherwise it doesnt get the right screenshot (?)
